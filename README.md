Detection and removal of cosmic peaks in Raman spectra.

The algorithm described in the paper https://doi.org/10.1002/jrs.6277


Run subtract_cosmics.py as the main file.

It includes two examples:

1) Raman spectrum of graphene with minor spikes that the commercial algorithm failed to remove;

2) Raman spectrum of biological sample from https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dib.2019.104694
   To use the second example, un-comment last three lines in subtract_cosmics.py
